# Risk Scoring Methodology

This document explains how risk levels (1â€“9) are assigned to questions in your Personal Footprint profile. Risk levels reflect how **sensitive or dangerous** it would be for this information to be publicly accessible or leaked.

---

## **Key Factors Considered**

1. **Sensitivity**: How easily this data could be used for identity theft, scams, or harassment.
2. **Online Availability**: How likely this data is already publicly searchable (e.g., via social media or public records).
3. **Linkability**: Whether this data can be combined with other details to compromise accounts (e.g., birthdate + birthplace).
4. **Permanence**: How hard it is to change the information (e.g., birthdate vs. email).

## **Risk Level Definitions**

| Level   | Description                                                                        | Examples                                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1â€“3** | **Low Risk**: Public or non-sensitive data. Minimal harm if exposed.               | First name, gender, hobbies.                         |
| **4â€“6** | **Medium Risk**: Could aid targeted phishing or profiling.                         | Employers, schools, social media links.              |
| **7â€“9** | **High Risk**: Directly enables fraud, identity theft, or physical/digital access. | Addresses, phone numbers, financial data, passwords. |

## **Common Data Type Classifications**

### **ðŸ”´ Extreme Risk (9)**

- **Passwords** (weak/reused ones)
- **Security question answers** (e.g., "motherâ€™s maiden name")
- **Crypto wallet keys**
- **Bank account/Payment app details**

### ðŸŸ¡ High Risk (7â€“8)

- **Phone numbers**
- **Home addresses**
- **Childrenâ€™s names**
- **Data breach exposure**

### ðŸŸ  Medium Risk (4â€“6)

- **Birthdate/Birthplace**
- **Pet names/breeds**
- **Vehicle registration**
- **Employer history**

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk (1â€“3)

- **Public social media profiles**
- **Hobbies/interests**
- **Public reviews/likes**
- **Device types (non-specific)**

---

## **Recommendations for Users**

- **Avoid entering Level 7â€“9 data** if unsure about device security.
- **Mask sensitive answers** (e.g., use partial birth years like "1990" instead of full dates).
- **Delete old accounts** associated with high-risk data (e.g., retired phone numbers).

---

## **Why Certain Data is High Risk**

- **Phone Numbers**: Can be used for SIM-swapping attacks or targeted spam.
- **Birthdate + Birthplace**: Often used to verify identity for banks/government services.
- **Pet Names**: Common security question answers (e.g., "first petâ€™s name").
